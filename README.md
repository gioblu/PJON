#PJON

This fork of [PJON](http://www.gioblu.com/PJON/PJON-github-header-tiny.png) aimed to add support of ESP-NOW strategy to esp8266 microcontroller.

Originally, I needed this for my project, but then I changed the approach in my project and this was no longer a priority for me.
Realistically, I will not finish this. Sorry. It's a good news that it is possible to make ESP-NOW work on esp8266. If anyone needs
it in the future, this repo and the [associated pull request](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/pull/361) can be used as a rough guide for a new implementation.
