## PJON 13.1
PJON (Padded Jittering Operative Network) is an experimental, arduino-compatible, multi-master, multi-media, software-defined network protocol that can be easily cross-compiled on many microcontrollers and real-time operative systems like ATtiny, ATmega, SAMD, ESP8266, ESP32, STM32, Teensy, Raspberry Pi, Zephyr, Linux, Windows x86, Apple and Android. PJON operates on a wide range of media, data links and existing protocols like PJDL, PJDLR, PJDLS, Serial, RS485, USB, ASK/FSK, LoRa, UDP, TCP, MQTT and ESPNOW. For more information visit the [documentation](documentation/README.md), the [specification](specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v4.0.md) or the [wiki](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki).

### Why PJON?
- **New technology**: [PJON](specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v4.0.md) is an experimental network protocol stack crafted in 10 years of research and experimentation. It was originally developed as an open-source alternative to i2c and 1-Wire but during development its scope and features have been extended to cover use cases where IP is generally applied. PJON has been engineered to have a variable footprint (4.2-8.2 kB program memory) and overhead (5-35 bytes per packet) depending on its configuration.
- **Multi-media support**: PJON operates upon a wide range of protocols like TCP, UDP, MQTT, ESPNOW, USB, Serial, RS485 and LoRa. The PJON network protocol stack specifies and implements also [PJDL](src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md) that operates over a single wire of up to 2000m shared by up to 255 devices, [PJDLR](src/strategies/OverSampling/specification/PJDLR-specification-v3.0.md) that operates with many ASK/FSK/OOK radio modules, and also [PJDLS](src/strategies/AnalogSampling/specification/PJDLS-specification-v2.0.md) that operates wirelessly with light pulses using off-the-shelf LEDs and laser diodes.
- **Increased reliability**: Many protocols massively applied worldwide expose dangerous vulnerabilities, have weak error detection algorithms and are not resilient to interference. PJON is based on years of analysis and study not to make the same mistakes present in most alternatives and provide with a simpler and more efficient solution.
- **High flexibility**: PJON is totally software-defined and it is designed to be easily extensible. it builds out-of-the-box in all supported devices and operates transparently on top of any supported protocol or medium.
- **Low cost**: With no additional hardware needed to operate, minimal network wiring requirements and direct pin-to-pin or LED-to-LED communication, PJON is extremely energy efficient, cheap to be implemented and maintained. This experimental reference implementation is kept updated thanks to the strong commitment of its growing community.

### Safety warning
When testing PJON, extreme care must be taken to avoid any danger. Consider that the implementation is experimental and may not behave as expected, use it at your own risk. When devices are connected to AC power you are exposed to a high chance of being electrocuted if hardware is not installed carefully and properly. If you are not experienced enough ask the support of a skilled technician and consider that many countries prohibit uncertified installations. When testing a [SoftwareBitBang](/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang) bus [interference mitigation](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki/Mitigate-interference) and [protective circuitry](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki/Protective-circuitry) guidelines must be followed. When experimenting with [AnalogSampling](/src/strategies/AnalogSampling) setup safety glasses must be worn and transceivers must be operated cautiously to avoid potential eye injuries. Before testing [OverSampling](/src/strategies/OverSampling), [ThroughSerial](/src/strategies/ThroughSerial) or [ThroughLoRa](/src/strategies/ThroughLoRa) radio communication, be sure the frequency, power and hardware used complies with local laws. When connecting a local bus to the internet all devices must be considered potentially compromised, manipulated or remotely actuated against your will. It should be considered a good practice not to connect to the internet systems that may create a damage (fire, flood, data-leak) if hacked.
