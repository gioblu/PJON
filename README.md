## PJON 13.1

PJON (Padded Jittering Operative Network) is an experimental, multi-master, software-defined network protocol that can be easily cross-compiled for many microcontrollers and real-time operating systems such as ATtiny, ATmega, SAMD, ESP8266, ESP32, STM32, Teensy, Raspberry Pi, Zephyr, Linux, Windows x86, Apple, and Android. PJON operates over a wide range of media, data links, and existing protocols like PJDL, PJDLR, PJDLS, Serial, RS485, USB, ASK/FSK, LoRa, UDP, TCP, MQTT, and ESPNOW. For more information, visit the [documentation](documentation/README.md), the [specification](specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v4.0.md), or the [wiki](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki).

### Why PJON?
- **New technology**: [PJON](specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v4.0.md) is an experimental network protocol stack crafted through 10 years of research and experimentation. It was originally developed as an open-source alternative to i2c and 1-Wire, but during development, its scope and features were extended to cover use cases where IP is generally applied. PJON has been engineered to have a variable footprint (4.2–8.2 kB program memory) and overhead (5–35 bytes per packet) depending on its configuration.
- **Multi-media support**: PJON operates over a wide range of protocols including TCP, UDP, MQTT, ESPNOW, USB, Serial, RS485, and LoRa. The PJON network protocol stack also specifies and implements [PJDL](src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v5.0.md) that operates over a single wire of up to 2000m shared by up to 255 devices, [PJDLR](src/strategies/OverSampling/specification/PJDLR-specification-v3.0.md) that operates with many ASK/FSK/OOK radio modules and [PJDLS](src/strategies/AnalogSampling/specification/PJDLS-specification-v2.0.md) that operates wirelessly with light pulses using off-the-shelf LEDs and laser diodes.
- **Increased reliability**: Many widely applied protocols expose significant vulnerabilities, have weak error detection algorithms, and are not resilient to interference. PJON is based on years of analysis and study to avoid the mistakes present in most alternatives and provide with a simpler and more efficient solution.
- **High flexibility**: PJON is fully software-defined and designed to be easily extensible. It builds out-of-the-box on all supported devices and operates transparently on top of any supported protocol or medium.
- **Low cost**: With no additional hardware needed to operate, minimal network wiring requirements, and direct pin-to-pin or LED-to-LED communication, PJON is extremely energy-efficient, inexpensive to implement, and maintain. This experimental reference implementation is kept up to date thanks to the strong commitment of its growing community.

### Safety warning
When testing PJON, take extreme care to avoid any danger. The implementation is experimental and may not behave as expected; use it at your own risk. If devices are connected to AC power, you face a high risk of electrocution unless the hardware is installed carefully and correctly. If you lack sufficient experience, seek assistance from a qualified technician, and be aware that many countries prohibit uncertified installations. When testing a [SoftwareBitBang](/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang) bus follow [interference-mitigation](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki/Mitigate-interference) and [protective-circuitry](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki/Protective-circuitry) guidelines. When experimenting with an AnalogSampling setup, wear safety glasses and operate transceivers cautiously to prevent eye injuries. Before testing [OverSampling](/src/strategies/OverSampling), [ThroughSerial](/src/strategies/ThroughSerial) or [ThroughLoRa](/src/strategies/ThroughLoRa) radio communication, ensure that the frequency, power, and hardware comply with local regulations. When connecting a local bus to the Internet, treat all devices as potentially compromised, manipulated, or remotely actuated against your will. As a best practice, avoid connecting to the internet systems that could cause damage (fire, flood, data leakage) if hacked.
