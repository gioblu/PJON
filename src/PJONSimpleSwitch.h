PJONSimpleSwitch has been contributed by Fred Larsen.

It routes packets between buses with different bus ids, and between segmented
buses as well, even for local buses with no bus ids. It is limited to one
single strategy in contrast to its descendant PJONSwitch.

A default gateway can be specified, identifying one of the attached buses to
receive packets to other target buses than any of the attached buses. It is
possible to use a PJONSimpleSwitch to handle leaf buses in a tree structure.

A segmented bus is a "virtual" bus where ranges of its devices are  located
in separate physical buses.

NAT (network address translation) support is present, allowing a local bus
to communicate with shared buses. To do this, the local bus must have the
bus id set to a public/NAT bus id with which it can be reached from other
buses, but be set to local mode and not shared mode.
Any incoming packet to the public bus id will be forwarded into the local bus
with the receiver bus id changed to 0.0.0.0 which is considered equivalent
with a local bus address.
Outgoing packets must be sent in shared mode with a sender bus id of 0.0.0.0,
which will be replaced with the NAT address when forwarded by the switch,
enabling receivers on shared buses to reply back to the local bus.
